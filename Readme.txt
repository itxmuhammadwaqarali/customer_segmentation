Customer Segmentation for Retail
Overview
This project focuses on segmenting retail customers based on their purchasing behavior using clustering techniques. The primary goal is to group customers into meaningful clusters to help businesses tailor personalized marketing strategies.

Objective
Perform RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) on retail customer data.
Apply clustering algorithms (K-Means and DBSCAN) to segment customers.
Visualize clusters and derive actionable insights.
Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

InvoiceNo: Unique invoice number.
StockCode: Product code.
Description: Product description.
Quantity: Quantity purchased.
InvoiceDate: Date of the transaction.
UnitPrice: Price per unit.
CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Country: Customer's country.
Steps Performed
1. Data Preparation
The dataset is loaded from an .xlsx file using pandas.
Handled missing values and ensured the InvoiceDate column is in datetime format.
Performed RFM Analysis:
Recency: Days since the customer's last purchase.
Frequency: Number of purchases by the customer.
Monetary: Total amount spent by the customer.
2. Feature Scaling
Used Min-Max Scaling to normalize RFM values for clustering.
3. Clustering Algorithms
K-Means Clustering:
Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
Assigned customers to clusters.
DBSCAN:
Explored density-based clustering as an alternative.
4. Visualization
Used PCA to reduce dimensions and visualize clusters in 2D space.
Visualized clusters for both K-Means and DBSCAN.
5. Cluster Analysis
Analyzed cluster characteristics (e.g., average RFM values for each cluster).
Suggested marketing strategies for each customer group.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy
Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Clustering and Scaling: sklearn
Dimensionality Reduction: PCA from sklearn
File Descriptions
customer_segmentation_data.xlsx: Input dataset containing transaction details.
customer_segmentation.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for customer segmentation.
rfm_with_clusters.xlsx: Output dataset with RFM values and cluster labels.
README.md: Documentation for the project.
How to Run
Prerequisites:

Python 3.8 or higher installed.
Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn.
Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., Anaconda or JupyterLab).
Steps:

Clone the repository or download the files.
Place the dataset (customer_segmentation_data.xlsx) in the same directory as the notebook.
Open the notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Run all the cells to perform data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
Output:

The preprocessed dataset with cluster labels will be saved as rfm_with_clusters.xlsx.
Results
The analysis grouped customers into distinct clusters based on their purchasing behavior.
Example marketing strategies for clusters:
Cluster 0: Re-engagement campaigns for customers with high recency and low frequency.
Cluster 1: Loyalty rewards for frequent and high-spending customers.
Cluster 2: Tailored promotions for moderate purchasers.
Cluster 3: VIP services for high-spending customers with lower frequency.
Future Enhancements
Include additional features like customer location or product categories.
Explore advanced clustering techniques (e.g., hierarchical clustering).
Automate the process for regular updates to customer segmentation.
